## Background
One day, I took the role of a Data Analyst at a company selling electronic products in the US. The company has only been running for one year in 2019. In order to increase sales in 2020, I evaluated the sales data in 2019.

There are 5 main questions I want to know based on an analysis on the sales data:
1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city sold the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

In this exploratory data analysis, I'll find out the answers for those questions.
