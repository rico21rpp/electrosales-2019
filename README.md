## Background
One day, I took the role of a Data Analyst at a company selling electronic products in the US. The company has only been running for one year in 2019. In order to increase sales in 2020, I evaluated the sales data in 2019.

There are 5 main questions I want to know based on an analysis on the sales data:
1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city sold the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customer’s buying product?
4. What product sold the most?
5. What product contributed the most to sales?

In this exploratory data analysis, I'll find out the answers for those questions.

## Findings
### Q1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
* The best month for sales in 2019 was **December**
* Sales in December was **$4,608,295.70**

### Q2. What city sold the most product?
The sales in the city of **San Francisco (California) show the best performance**, both in terms of the **quantity ordered** and the total **value of sales** that were obtained.

### Q3. What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customer’s buying product?
* The daily average sales have increased quite steadily from 3 to 11 o'clock. Therefore, **it is recommended to display ads from 3 until 11 AM**.
* If we want the ads to be effectively useful, then **Tuesday is the recommended day to show ads to customers** because that day has the highest sales than any other day. On the other hand, **it is not recommended to show important ads on Thursdays** as these are the lowest sales of the week.

### Q4. What product sold the most?
**AAA Batteries (4-pack) is the most sold product** followed by **AA Batteries (4-pack)** and **USB-C Charging Cable** in the second & third place.

### Q5. What product contributed the most to sales?
* The product contributed the most on the company's sales in 2019 is **Macbook Pro Laptop**
* The sales of this product has a **significant difference** with the sales of another products.

## Future Research
1. What are the reasons behind the conclusions of Q4 and Q5?
2. What types of products are selling the most and the reasons behind them?
3. What products are sold the most in each city?
4. In what month did Macbook Pro Laptop sell the most?
5. In which city is Macbook Pro Laptop selling the most?
6. What products are most often sold together?
